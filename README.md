# 100Days-of-Python
Udemy's 100 days of python


The begining is just loops and if, else.

Days 1-10:


Basic things, if/or, for loops, ints and floats, basic dictionaries
Day 7 has a hangman game that I found a bit more tricky
Day 10 has formatting


Day 11-20:

More complicated dictionaries, reading JS files, Python classes, Turtle library
