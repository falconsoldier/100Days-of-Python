#This is a Restaurant Bill Generator

bill = float(input("How much was the bill?"))
ptip = int(input("What percentage is the tip? (In whole numbers)"))
split = int(input("How many people are splitting the check?"))

tip = round(bill * (ptip/100), 2)
share = round((tip + bill)/split, 2)

#print("The tip is: $" + str(tip) + " and each person will pay: $" + str(share))
# after I learned about .format I added that instead, it looks a bit cleaner imo
print("The tip is: ${0:.2f} and each person will pay ${1:.2f}".format(tip, share))
